abstract = {Teachable self-help techniques, such as mindfulness, can reduce anxiety and improve mental well-being outcomes. However, people lack proper awareness of such techniques. In this work, we explore the design space of using online dissemination channels to help people learn about mindfulness. We investigate the potential benefits of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve awareness and willingness to practice these techniques, building on a video-based intervention to introduce mindfulness. We designed a pilot between subjects randomized factorial experiment of 2 (Informational Chatbot: present vs. absent) x 2 (Tutorial Video: present vs. absent) x 2 (Reflection Chatbot: present vs. absent). Our preliminary findings suggest that interaction with either of the chatbots improved the participants’ intent to practice Mindfulness again, and the tutorial video improved the participants’ reported overall experience of the exercise. This highlights the potential promise and outlines the directions for exploring the use of LLM-based chatbots for awareness-related interventions.},
