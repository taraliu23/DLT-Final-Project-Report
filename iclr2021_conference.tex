\begin{abstract}
Patients with co-occurring mental health disorders and genetic conditions face significant challenges in accessing resources, navigating clinical trials, and receiving personalized care. This project addresses these gaps by developing a WebApp that integrates sentiment analysis and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide trustworthy, contextually relevant information.

The study leverages subreddit discussions to analyze public sentiment and uses these insights to inform the design of an interactive Q&A chat interface and a static knowledge hub. The WebApp empowers users, especially those without a research background, to access curated resources and answers to their queries. Sentiment analysis revealed pervasive frustrations and gaps in existing support systems, emphasizing the need for patient-centered tools.

The results demonstrate the potential of RAG-enhanced language models to minimize hallucinations and provide accurate responses, as validated through a 50-question simulated Q&A evaluation. While the current implementation focuses on foundational functionalities, future enhancements will include personalized recommendations, advanced clinical trial search, and robust privacy features.

This work highlights the transformative role of AI in bridging healthcare accessibility gaps, particularly for underserved populations. By combining advanced computational methods with patient-centric design, the project sets the stage for a comprehensive platform that addresses the unique needs of individuals with genetic-linked mental disorders.

\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Background}

Mental disorders (eg. depression, anxiety) are the result of a combination of environment and genetic variation.

Mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, arise from a complex interplay of environmental factors and genetic variations. These conditions are not only prevalent but also highly impactful, often affecting individuals’ quality of life and productivity. Recent advances in genetics and computational tools have highlighted the potential to personalize mental health care. However, patients with co-occurring mental health and genetic disorders face unique challenges in accessing support and resources.

\subsection{Motivation}

Assist patients with mental health and genetic disorders in finding: Self-help resources, Appropriate clinical trials, and Provide accessible tools, especially for those without a research background.

This study seeks to address the unmet needs of patients with mental health and genetic disorders by:

Providing Self-Help Resources: Empowering patients to take proactive steps in managing their conditions.
Facilitating Access to Clinical Trials: Helping patients identify appropriate clinical trials tailored to their unique genetic and mental health profiles.
Improving Accessibility: Developing tools that cater to patients without a research or medical background, thereby bridging the knowledge gap.


Despite advancements in research and technology, patients with genetic-linked mental disorders encounter several obstacles:

Exclusion and Lack of Resources:

Many patients feel overwhelmed and unsupported in navigating the complex healthcare landscape.
Exclusion Criteria: Individuals with genetic disorders are often excluded from mental health trials, further limiting their treatment options.
Barriers to Access:
Procedural: Clinical trials often fail to generalize findings to individual cases.
Economic: Costs related to genetics testing and counseling are frequently excluded from insurance coverage.
Clinician Awareness: Limited knowledge, misconceptions about cost-effectiveness, and lack of training hinder clinicians from recommending genetic resources.
Ethical Concerns: Stigmatization and exclusion from essential health services exacerbate the challenges for these patients.
Trust and Safety Issues:

Ethics Errors: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT often refuse valid health-related queries due to overzealous ethical safeguards, leaving patients without critical information.
Security Concerns: Risks associated with commercial LLMs, including data privacy and misuse, further erode trust in these tools.

\section{Literature Survey}

Existing tools focus on clinical databases and fail to address:
Patient needs and sentiments
Specific mental health-genetic disorder resources
Open-source implementation

Example Study:Boosting GPT Models for Genomics Analysis[9]
Generates trusted genetic variant annotations and interpretations through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning.

Existing tools primarily focus on leveraging clinical databases, but they lack the ability to address key issues, such as:

Patient Needs and Sentiments: Current systems do not consider the emotional and informational needs of patients, particularly those with genetic-linked mental disorders.
Tailored Resources: There is an absence of resources specifically designed for individuals with co-occurring genetic and mental health conditions.
Open-Source Implementation: Most existing solutions are proprietary, limiting accessibility and scalability.
Example Study:
A notable example is Boosting GPT Models for Genomics Analysis [9], which demonstrates the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating trusted genetic variant annotations and interpretations. While promising, this approach does not integrate patient-specific needs or mental health aspects, highlighting the gap this study aims to address.

\section{Method}



\subsection{Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)}

Sentiment Analysis with Transformers 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) with Llama2 cpp
RAG > Fine-tune
less likely to “hallucinate”
control on hallucination
keep the LLM fixed and unmodified

This study employs RAG to improve the accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs while addressing patient-specific needs. The methodology includes:

Sentiment Analysis with Transformers: Using state-of-the-art models to analyze patient sentiment and identify emotional or informational gaps.
RAG Implementation with Llama2-cpp: Integrating RAG to enhance retrieval capabilities, ensuring that LLM outputs are grounded in relevant, trusted data.
Fine-Tuning and Hallucination Control:
Fine-tuning LLMs with domain-specific data minimizes the likelihood of generating hallucinated information.
Keeping the LLM fixed while employing retrieval ensures the integrity and reliability of generated content.
By combining sentiment analysis with RAG, this approach prioritizes patient needs while maintaining control over the accuracy and relevance of the model's outputs.

\section{Result and Conclusion}

The system was evaluated through a 50-question simulated Q&A comparison, with responses assessed by human reviewers and ChatGPT-4.0 for:

Helpfulness: Assessing the relevance and accuracy of the response.
Structural Compliance: Evaluating whether the response adhered to a logical and user-friendly structure.
Task Completeness: Ensuring that the response fully addressed the user’s query.
